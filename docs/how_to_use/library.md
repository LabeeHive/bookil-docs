## Search

Enter a string of text in the search form at the top of the screen to narrow your search to matching files.

## Sort

The sort function will reorder the display of the list according to the rules you specify.

- Recent ... Sort by access order.
- Name ... Sort by file name.
- Progress ... Sort by progress.

## Unread/Read Filter

The filter allows you to narrow down your search to files in a specified state.

- All ... Show all files
- Unread ... Show only files that have never been opened
- Reading ... Show only the file you are reading
- Read ... Displays files where all pages have been read

## Switching the number of columns

You can freely switch the number of PDF columns displayed on the screen.
This allows the user to adjust the readability of the list according to the size of the screen and their preferences.

The default is two columns.

## Switching between unread and read

You can change a PDF in unread status to `Read` or a PDF in read status to `Unread`.

1. Long press a PDF file in Library view
1. Tap "Mark as read" or `Mark as unread` in the menu that appears.

## Delete from device

Some PDFs are large in file size.  
This app also allows you to delete files from the list screen.

1. Long press a PDF file in Library view
1. Tap `Delete from device` on the menu that appears.

Deleting a file does not delete your reading history from your device.
