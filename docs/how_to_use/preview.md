## View a PDF file

You can view and read the specified PDF file.  
In this view, you can zoom in and out, select and copy text, translate, and use other common functions.

## Memorize reading point

Bookil saves the reading position so that when you open the PDF again, you can open it from the position where you last read it.  

Since Bookil maintains its own reading history, you can read from the same location even if you import the PDF again after deleting it from your device.

## Move pages with the seek bar

You can easily move pages with the seek bar at the bottom of the screen that appears after tapping.
