Welcome to Bookil website!

## What is Bookil?

Bookil[bʊk-ɪl] is a PDF viewer application.  
This app manages the reading status separately from the PDF, so even if you delete the file after reading is complete, the reading history will remain.  
It is also easy to import PDF files from other apps.

### Future implementations

The following features have not been implemented yet, but are being tested and brushed up locally.

- Data sharing within the same iCloud account (iCloud backup)
- Display of table of contents in the preview screen
- Bookmarks
